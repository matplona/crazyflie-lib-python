This functionality is experimental and may not work properly!

Script to run a full base station geometry estimation of a lighthouse
system. The script records data from a Crazyflie that is moved around in
the flight space and creates a solution that minimizes the error
in the measured positions.

The execution of the script takes you through a number of steps, please follow
the instructions.

This script supports large systems with more than 2 base stations (if
supported by the CF firmware).

This script is a temporary implementation until similar functionality has been
added to the client.

Prerequisite:
1. The base station calibration data must have been
received by the Crazyflie before this script is executed.
2. Base stations must point downwards, towards the floor.
